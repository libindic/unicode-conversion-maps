# Unicode Conversion Maps

This is a global repository to hold community curated maps to convert from ASCII to Unicode.

## History

* [Payyans](https://github.com/libindic/payyans) is the origin of a lot of map files.
* [Freaknz](https://gitlab.com/kannanvm/freaknz-qt/) brought renewed interest in ASCII -> Unicode conversion
* [ttf.js](https://github.com/ynakajima/ttf.js) is where the idea of showing glyphs in the browser came from.
* [opentype.js](https://github.com/opentypejs/opentype.js) allowed for bug-free opening of glyphs.
